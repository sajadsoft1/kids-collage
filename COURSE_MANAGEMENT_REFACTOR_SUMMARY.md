# Course Management System Refactor Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the course management system database structure from a simple Course->Session->Resource hierarchy to a comprehensive template-based system supporting multiple course types, terms, payments, and progress tracking.

## New Architecture

### Template-Based Design
The system now separates **templates** (fixed content definitions) from **instances** (actual course runs):

- **CourseTemplate**: Defines course structure (English Level 1)
- **SessionTemplate**: Defines individual lessons (Lesson 1: Alphabet)
- **Course**: Actual course instance in a specific term
- **Session**: Actual scheduled class sessions

### Key Models Created

#### Core Templates
1. **CourseTemplate** - Course definitions with metadata
2. **SessionTemplate** - Lesson definitions with ordering
3. **Resource** - Polymorphic educational materials

#### Academic Structure
4. **Term** - Academic periods (Fall 2025, Spring 2026)
5. **Room** - Physical locations for in-person courses

#### Course Execution
6. **Course** - Real course instances with teachers and schedules
7. **Session** - Scheduled class sessions (virtual for self-paced)

#### Student Management
8. **Enrollment** - Student registrations with progress tracking
9. **Attendance** - Session attendance records
10. **Certificate** - Course completion certificates

#### Payment Integration
11. **OrderItem** - Payment links with polymorphic item support

#### Activity Tracking
12. **ActivityLog** - Comprehensive activity and progress logging

## Enums Created

- `CourseType`: in-person, online, hybrid, self-paced
- `SessionType`: in-person, online, hybrid
- `CourseStatus`: draft, scheduled, active, finished, cancelled
- `SessionStatus`: planned, done, cancelled
- `EnrollmentStatus`: pending, paid, active, dropped
- `ResourceType`: pdf, video, image, link
- `TermStatus`: draft, active, finished

## Key Features Implemented

### Course Types Support
- **In-Person**: Traditional classroom courses
- **Online**: Live virtual sessions
- **Hybrid**: Combination of in-person and online
- **Self-Paced**: Udemy-style courses with virtual sessions

### Resource Management
- Polymorphic resources attached to templates or instances
- Support for PDFs, videos, images, and links
- Signed URLs for secure video access
- RBAC for access control

### Progress Tracking
- Enrollment progress percentage
- Granular session completion tracking
- Activity logging for detailed analytics
- Certificate issuance on completion

### Payment Integration
- OrderItem model with polymorphic relationships
- Support for enrollment-based payments
- Refund policy handling
- Discount calculation support

### Scheduling System
- Automatic session generation from templates
- Support for multiple days per week
- Room availability checking
- Conflict detection and resolution

### Attendance Management
- Present/absent tracking with timestamps
- Excuse note support
- Quality scoring based on punctuality
- Attendance percentage calculations

## Business Methods Implemented

### Course Management
- `enrollStudent()`: Safe enrollment with capacity checking
- `reserveSeat()`: Temporary seat reservation
- `cloneSessions()`: Auto-generate sessions from templates
- `isAtCapacity()`: Capacity management

### Progress Tracking
- `updateProgress()`: Progress percentage updates
- `markAsCompleted()`: Course completion handling
- `issueCertificate()`: Automatic certificate generation

### Resource Security
- `getSignedUrl()`: Secure resource access
- `generateSignature()`: Certificate verification
- `verifySignature()`: Certificate validation

### Analytics & Reporting
- `getUserStatistics()`: Student activity analytics
- `getCourseStatistics()`: Course performance metrics
- `getSalesStatistics()`: Revenue tracking

## Database Relationships

### Template Hierarchy
```
CourseTemplate (1) -> (n) SessionTemplate
CourseTemplate (1) -> (n) Course (instances)
SessionTemplate (1) -> (n) Session (instances)
```

### Resource Polymorphism
```
Resource -> morphTo -> [CourseTemplate, SessionTemplate, Session]
```

### Student Journey
```
Course (1) -> (n) Enrollment (1) -> (n) Attendance
Enrollment (1) -> (1) Certificate
```

### Payment Flow
```
OrderItem -> morphTo -> [Course, Enrollment]
```

## Security Features

- Signed URLs for video resources
- Certificate signature verification
- RBAC for resource access
- Audit logging via ActivityLog
- Secure enrollment with race condition prevention

## Scalability Considerations

- Database transactions for enrollment
- Atomic capacity checking
- Efficient querying with proper indexes
- Polymorphic relationships for flexibility
- Soft deletes for data retention

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Self-Paced Course
```php
$course = Course::create([
    'course_template_id' => $template->id,
    'term_id' => $longTerm->id,
    'teacher_id' => $teacher->id,
    'type' => CourseType::SELF_PACED,
    'price' => 99.99,
    'capacity' => null, // Unlimited
]);

$course->cloneSessions(); // Creates virtual sessions
```

### Enrolling a Student
```php
$enrollment = $course->enrollStudent($student->id, $orderItem->id);
$enrollment->updateProgress(25.0); // 25% complete
```

### Tracking Progress
```php
$enrollment->logActivity('video.watched', [
    'resource_id' => $video->id,
    'duration' => 1800, // 30 minutes
]);
```

## Migration Path

The new system is designed to work alongside existing data. Key migration steps:

1. Create new template records from existing courses
2. Migrate existing sessions to new Session model
3. Update resource relationships to polymorphic
4. Migrate enrollment data with progress tracking
5. Generate certificates for completed courses

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Flexibility**: Support for multiple course types and delivery methods
2. **Reusability**: Templates eliminate content duplication
3. **Scalability**: Polymorphic design supports future expansion
4. **Analytics**: Comprehensive activity tracking and reporting
5. **Security**: Proper access controls and verification systems
6. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and relationships

This refactored system provides a solid foundation for a modern, scalable course management platform that can handle diverse educational needs while maintaining data integrity and performance.
