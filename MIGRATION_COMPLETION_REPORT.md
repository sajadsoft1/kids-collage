- `EnrollmentStatus` - Enrollment statuses (pending, paid, active, dropped)
- `ResourceType` - Resource types (pdf, video, image, link)
- `TermStatus` - Term statuses (draft, active, finished)

### 5. Database Migration Execution
- Successfully executed `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
- All new tables created with proper relationships
- Foreign key constraints established
- Indexes added for performance optimization
- Sample data seeded successfully

### 6. Model Testing
- âœ… CourseTemplate model working correctly

```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Migration Strategy
- Used `migrate:fresh --seed` for clean development environment
- Removed conflicting old migrations
- Created new migrations with proper dependency order
- Added default data for existing system compatibility

### Model Relationships
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Polymorphic relationships for resources and order items
- Soft deletes for data integrity
- JSON casting for complex data types

### Performance Optimization
- Strategic indexing for common queries
- Composite indexes for relationship queries
- Proper foreign key constraints for data integrity

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update Controllers**: Modify existing controllers to use new models
2. **Update Views**: Adapt views to new data structure
3. **Update Actions**: Modify existing actions for new relationships
4. **Test Functionality**: Comprehensive testing of all features

### Future Enhancements
